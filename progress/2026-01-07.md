# 📅 Progress Log — January 7, 2026

## ✅ Overview
Today I wrapped up the **React Hooks** section, completing the final lessons and reinforcing my understanding of custom hooks, debugging strategies, and advanced patterns for functional components.

## 💻 Extra Learning: React Hooks
### ✅ Completed Lessons / Tasks
- Completed React Hooks 7 (9:16)
- Completed React Hooks 8 (4:48)
- Reviewed project files for Hooks
- Completed React Hooks 9 (5:58)

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **Custom hooks** allow encapsulating logic and sharing it across multiple components.  
- Debugging hook-based components requires careful tracking of state changes and dependencies.  
- Hooks encourage a **modular design** that scales better than class-based components.  

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Created a custom hook to handle form input logic.  
- Combined multiple hooks in a single component for complex state management.  
- Debugged a hook-based component to ensure correct re-render behavior.  

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- Best practices for naming and organizing custom hooks.  
- How to integrate hooks with external libraries (e.g., data fetching, routing).  

## ✅ Summary
A productive wrap-up of the React Hooks section — I now feel confident using hooks not only for state and side effects but also for building reusable, modular logic across applications.
