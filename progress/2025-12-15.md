# 📅 Progress Log — December 15, 2025

## ✅ Overview
Today I began the **Advanced JavaScript** module.  
This session focused on scope and advanced control flow. I practiced how variables behave in different contexts and explored more complex conditional logic.

### ✅ Completed Lessons
- Scope (10m 25s) + Exercise  
- Advanced Control Flow (11m 41s)

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **Scope** defines where variables and functions are accessible, distinguishing between global, local, and block scope.  
- Understanding scope is critical for avoiding bugs and writing predictable code.  
- **Advanced control flow** expands on conditionals, using nested logic and more complex decision structures.  
- These concepts prepare the foundation for working with larger applications and cleaner code organization.  

---

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Practiced exercises on **scope**, testing variable accessibility in different contexts.  
- Built small examples using **nested conditionals** and advanced control flow patterns.  
- Experimented with combining scope and control flow to simulate real‑world logic.

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- How does **scope** interact with functions and closures in JavaScript?  
- Best practices for managing deeply nested control flow.  
- Explore modern alternatives like **optional chaining** and **nullish coalescing** for cleaner logic.

## ✅ Summary
A solid start to the **Advanced JavaScript** module.  
I learned how scope controls variable visibility and how advanced control flow enables complex decision‑making. These lessons strengthen my ability to write structured, reliable code.  
Next step: continue with **functions, ES6 features, and deeper data structures** in advanced JavaScript.
