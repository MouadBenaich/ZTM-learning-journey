## 💻 Advanced JavaScript

### ✅ Completed Lessons 
- Advanced Arrays (16m 40s) + Exercise  

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **Scope** defines variable accessibility across global, local, and block contexts.  
- **Advanced control flow** enables complex decision-making with nested logic.  
- **ES5 vs ES6** introduced modern syntax like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, and template literals.  
- **Advanced functions** highlight higher-order functions, callbacks, and cleaner code organization.  
- **Advanced arrays** provide powerful methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) for functional programming and data manipulation.

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Tested variable scope with exercises.  
- Built examples using advanced control flow structures.  
- Practiced ES5 vs ES6 syntax differences.  
- Implemented advanced function exercises with callbacks and higher-order functions.  
- Applied array methods to solve practical problems and optimize code.

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- Explore closures and how they interact with scope.  
- Best practices for refactoring deeply nested control flow.  
- More practice with ES6 features like destructuring and spread/rest operators.  
- Deep dive into performance considerations when using array methods on large datasets.

## ✅ Summary
Strong progress in **Advanced JavaScript** today.  
Learned scope, advanced control flow, ES5/ES6 syntax, advanced functions, and advanced arrays.  
These lessons build a solid foundation for modern JavaScript development and prepare for upcoming topics like closures and asynchronous programming.
