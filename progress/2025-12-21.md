# 📅 Progress Log — December 21, 2025

## ✅ Overview
Continued the **Advanced JavaScript** module.  
Built on ES6/ES7 concepts and introduced ES8 (ES2017), focusing on new language features and practical exercises.  

---

## 💻 Advanced JavaScript

### ✅ Completed Lessons
- ES8 (ES2017) (9m 19s) + Exercise  

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **ES7 (2016)**: learned about `Array.prototype.includes()` and the exponentiation operator `**`.  
- **ES8 (2017)**: introduced `async/await` for handling asynchronous code more cleanly.  
- Reinforced understanding of scope, control flow, and modern syntax.  
- Practiced advanced object handling and destructuring.  
- Clarified differences between pass by value vs reference in real-world examples.  
- Strengthened awareness of type coercion pitfalls and safe practices.  

---

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Implemented ES7 features in small coding tasks.  
- Built async functions using `async/await` and tested with promises.  
- Applied ES6+ syntax consistently across exercises.  
- Practiced array and object manipulation with modern methods.  
- Completed exercises for ES7 and ES8 to reinforce new concepts.  

---

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- Explore deeper use cases of `async/await` with error handling (`try/catch`).  
- Compare performance of ES7 vs ES8 features in larger applications.  
- Investigate how ES8 integrates with modern frameworks like React or Node.js.  
- Review advanced object patterns and closures in asynchronous contexts.  

---

## ✅ Summary
Solid progress in **Advanced JavaScript** today.  
Mastered ES7 features and began working with ES8’s `async/await`, which simplifies asynchronous programming.  
This marks a key step toward modern JavaScript mastery and prepares for upcoming ES9+ topics.
