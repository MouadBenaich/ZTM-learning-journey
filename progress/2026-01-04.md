# 📅 Progress Log — January 4, 2026

## ✅ Overview
Today I advanced further into the **React.js Fundamentals (v19)** section, focusing on interactivity and layout improvements. I implemented the search functionality, introduced a scrollable container for the robot cards, and ensured the search panel remains sticky at the top. I also debugged API fetch issues and corrected the `response.json()` typo that was breaking the app.

## 💻 React.js Fundamentals (v19)
### ✅ Completed Lessons / Tasks
- Implemented SearchBox component with dynamic filtering
- Added Scroll component with custom height and overflow
- Applied sticky positioning to the search panel
- Fixed API fetch error (`response.json()` typo)
- Integrated secondary scrollbar styling to match neon design
- Confirmed CardList renders correctly with filtered robots

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Sticky positioning (`position: sticky; top: 0;`) keeps UI elements fixed during scroll without breaking layout.
- Wrapping components in a scroll container requires a fixed height and `overflow-y: auto` for proper behavior.
- Small typos like `.jason()` vs `.json()` can cause runtime errors — attention to detail is critical.
- Custom scrollbar styling can be scoped to specific containers for consistent design without affecting the global page.

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Built a functional search bar that filters robot names in real time.
- Created a `Scroll` wrapper to isolate card list scrolling from the rest of the page.
- Scoped neon scrollbar styles to `.scroll-container` for design consistency.
- Debugged and fixed API fetch errors by correcting the JSON parsing method.
- Verified that the robot dashboard now supports both searching and smooth scrolling.

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- How to best structure reusable layout components (e.g., Scroll, Panel) for scalability.
- Whether to keep Tachyons for utility styling or gradually migrate to a custom CSS system.
- How to optimize API calls and error handling for production readiness.

## ✅ Summary
A strong day of progress — I enhanced the robot dashboard with search and scroll functionality, fixed critical API errors, and aligned the secondary scrollbar with the site’s neon aesthetic. The app now feels more interactive, polished, and consistent with the overall design system.
