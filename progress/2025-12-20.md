# 📅 Progress Log — December 20, 2025

## ✅ Overview
Continued the **Advanced JavaScript** module.  
Focused on reinforcing ES5/ES6 concepts, advanced objects, and introduced new topics like ES7 (ES2016).

## 💻 Advanced JavaScript

### ✅ Completed Lessons 
- ES7 (ES2016) (3m 06s) + Exercise  

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **Scope & Control Flow**: solidified understanding of variable lifetimes and complex conditional logic.  
- **ES5 vs ES6**: modern syntax (`let`, `const`, arrow functions, template literals) improves readability and safety.  
- **Advanced Functions**: higher-order functions and callbacks are essential for functional programming patterns.  
- **Advanced Arrays**: methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` streamline data manipulation.  
- **Advanced Objects**: destructuring and shorthand properties simplify object handling.  
- **Pass By Value vs Reference**: clarified how primitives and objects behave differently when passed into functions.  
- **Type Coercion**: highlighted implicit vs explicit conversions and equality pitfalls.  
- **ES7 (ES2016)**: introduced new operators like `includes()` for arrays and the exponentiation operator `**`.

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Applied scope and control flow exercises.  
- Practiced ES6 syntax alongside ES5 equivalents.  
- Implemented higher-order functions and callbacks.  
- Solved challenges using array methods.  
- Used object destructuring in exercises.  
- Tested pass by value vs reference with arrays and objects.  
- Experimented with type coercion in equality checks.  
- Practiced ES7 features (`includes`, `**`) in small coding tasks.  

---

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- Explore closures in more depth.  
- Compare ES6 and ES7 features in real-world projects.  
- Investigate performance trade-offs of array/object operations.  
- Study best practices to avoid type coercion bugs.  
- Look into async/await (ES8) as the next step.  

---

## ✅ Summary
Solid progress in **Advanced JavaScript** today.  
Reinforced ES5/ES6 concepts, advanced objects, and learned ES7 features with practical exercises.  
This builds a strong foundation for modern JavaScript development and prepares for upcoming ES8 topics like async/await.
