# 📅 Progress Log — January 6, 2026

## ✅ Overview
Today I continued exploring the **React Hooks** section, moving deeper into practical applications. I focused on how hooks can be combined, how they simplify component logic, and how they improve reusability across different parts of a React app.

## 💻 Extra Learning: React Hooks
### ✅ Completed Lessons / Tasks
- Completed React Hooks 4 (4:01)
- Completed React Hooks 5 (3:45)
- Completed React Hooks 6 (6:54)

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Hooks can be **chained together** to manage multiple aspects of state and side effects.  
- Breaking logic into smaller hooks improves **readability and reusability**.  
- Understanding cleanup functions in `useEffect` is essential for managing subscriptions and timers.  

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Built a component that uses multiple `useState` hooks for different values.  
- Implemented cleanup logic inside `useEffect` to avoid memory leaks.  
- Practiced extracting logic into a **custom hook** for reuse.  

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- How to structure custom hooks for maximum clarity.  
- When to prefer custom hooks over higher-order components.  

## ✅ Summary
A solid day of progress — I gained confidence in combining hooks and started experimenting with custom hooks, which will be crucial for building scalable React applications.
