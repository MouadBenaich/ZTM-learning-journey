# 📅 Progress Log — December 13, 2025

## ✅ Overview
Today I continued the **JavaScript fundamentals** module.  
This session focused on variables, control flow, functions, and arrays. I also completed several practical exercises and built my first small interactive projects.

## 💻 JavaScript Fundamentals

### ✅ Completed Lessons
- Exercise: Number, String, Boolean, Comparisons  
- Variables (15m 09s) + exercise  
- Exercise: Make a Calculator  
- Control Flow (16m 36s) + Exercise: Make a Keyless Car  
- JavaScript on Our Webpage (9m 05s)  
- Functions (23m 53s) + Exercise: Make a Keyless Car Even Better  
- Data Structures: Arrays (13m 06s) + Exercise

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Variables store and manage data, forming the foundation of any program.  
- Control flow enables decision‑making in applications through conditional logic.  
- Functions make code reusable and modular, improving clarity and structure.  
- Arrays allow handling collections of data efficiently.  
- Combining these concepts in small projects (Calculator, Keyless Car) shows how JavaScript powers real interactivity.

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Built a **Calculator App** to perform basic arithmetic operations.  
- Implemented a **Keyless Car** logic system using conditionals.  
- Enhanced the Keyless Car with **functions** for cleaner, reusable code.  
- Practiced **array manipulation** (adding, removing, iterating).

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- Explore more advanced **array methods** like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.  
- Best practices for organizing functions in larger projects.  
- How JavaScript interacts with the DOM when handling user input.

## ✅ Summary
A strong continuation of the **JavaScript fundamentals** module.  
I completed multiple exercises and built my first interactive projects, reinforcing the importance of logic, data structures, and reusable code.  
Next step: move on to **objects, loops, and more advanced data structures**, then prepare for Git & GitHub basics.
