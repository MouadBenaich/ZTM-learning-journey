## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **Scope** defines variable accessibility across global, local, and block contexts.  
- **Advanced control flow** enables complex decision-making with nested logic.  
- **ES5 vs ES6** introduced modern syntax like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, and template literals.  
- **Advanced functions** highlight higher-order functions, callbacks, and cleaner code organization.  

---

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Tested variable scope with exercises.  
- Built examples using advanced control flow structures.  
- Practiced ES5 vs ES6 syntax differences.  
- Implemented advanced function exercises with callbacks and higher-order functions.  

---

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- Explore closures and how they interact with scope.  
- Best practices for refactoring deeply nested control flow.  
- More practice with ES6 features like destructuring and spread/rest operators.
