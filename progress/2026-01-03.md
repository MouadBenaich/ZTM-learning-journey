# 📅 Progress Log — January 3, 2026

## ✅ Overview
Today I continued the **React.js Fundamentals (v19)** section, focusing on project configuration, service worker setup, and building my first custom component. I also fixed issues related to React 18’s rendering API and ensured that my robot dashboard displays correctly.

## 💻 React.js Fundamentals (v19)
### ✅ Completed Lessons / Tasks
- Service Worker Setup & Fixes
- ReportWebVitals Integration
- Migrated `index.js` to React 18 (`createRoot`)
- Card Component Rendering
- Robot Image Randomization Fix
- Tachyons Styling Applied

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- React 18 uses `createRoot` instead of `ReactDOM.render`, which simplifies rendering and aligns with concurrent features.
- Service workers require **named imports** (`register`, `unregister`) rather than default imports.
- Template literals (backticks) are essential for dynamic string interpolation in JSX.
- Tachyons provides quick, responsive styling with utility classes, making UI prototyping faster.

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Fixed the `serviceWorkerRegistration` import error by switching to named imports.
- Updated `index.js` to use `ReactDOM.createRoot` for rendering.
- Built a reusable `Card` component and confirmed it renders correctly on the index page.
- Corrected the robot image source to use template literals for unique IDs.
- Applied Tachyons classes to style the card layout with shadows, spacing, and hover effects.

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- How to structure multiple components into a dashboard (mapping over arrays of data).
- Best practices for integrating service workers in production React apps.
- How Tachyons compares to other CSS utility frameworks like Tailwind.

## ✅ Summary
A productive day refining my React setup — I resolved key errors, learned the importance of proper imports and rendering in React 18, and successfully built a styled, dynamic `Card` component. My robot dashboard now displays unique images and looks polished with Tachyons styling.
