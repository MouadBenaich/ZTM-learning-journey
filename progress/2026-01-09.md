# 📅 Progress Log — January 9, 2026

## ✅ Overview
Today I transitioned from asynchronous JavaScript into the **Backend Introduction, APIs, and Problem Solving** sections. This session focused on understanding how backends work, how APIs connect front-end applications to external services, and how deliberate practice strengthens problem-solving skills.

## 💻 Completed Lessons / Tasks
- Backend Basics (12m 07s)  
- Getting Ready For This Section  
- Introduction to APIs (13m 31s)  
- Exercise: Web App API  
- Resources: Public APIs  
- Snapshot Model of Learning (6m 16s)  
- Deliberate Practice (6m 33s)  
- Exercise: Deliberate Practice  

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **Backends** provide the logic and data handling behind web applications, powering the front-end experience.  
- **APIs** act as bridges between applications, enabling communication and data exchange.  
- Public APIs are valuable resources for learning and building projects quickly.  
- **Problem solving** is a skill that improves with deliberate practice and reflection, not just coding speed.  
- The snapshot model emphasizes breaking problems into smaller, manageable pieces to reduce overwhelm.  

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Explored how a simple backend interacts with a front-end app.  
- Connected a demo React app to a public API to fetch data.  
- Practiced deliberate problem-solving exercises to strengthen debugging and logical thinking.  

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- Best practices for structuring API calls in larger React projects.  
- How to balance using public APIs with building custom backend logic.  
- Strategies for applying deliberate practice consistently in daily coding sessions.  

## ✅ Summary
A productive day focused on backend fundamentals, API integration, and sharpening problem-solving skills. These lessons build the foundation for the upcoming **SmartBrain Front-End project**, where I’ll apply these concepts in a real-world React + API integration scenario.
