## 💻 Advanced JavaScript

### ✅ Completed Lessons
- Advanced Loops (12m 04s) + Exercise  

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **ES10 (2019)**: learned `Array.flat()`, `Array.flatMap()`, and `Object.fromEntries()` for cleaner data handling.  
- **Advanced Loops**: explored `for...of`, `for...in`, and modern iteration patterns for arrays and objects.  
- Reinforced how newer ECMAScript versions improve readability and efficiency.  
- Exercises provided practical applications of ES10 features and loop structures.  

---

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Applied ES10 methods to manipulate nested arrays and object entries.  
- Practiced advanced loop constructs to iterate over complex data structures.  
- Compared traditional `for` loops with modern iteration methods.  
- Completed exercises to solidify ES10 and advanced loop concepts.

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- Explore performance differences between `for...of` and `forEach` in large datasets.  
- Investigate compatibility of ES10 features across older browsers.  
- Review best practices for choosing loop types in real-world projects.  
- Experiment with combining ES10 methods and advanced loops in projects.
