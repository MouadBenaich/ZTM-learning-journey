## 💻 Advanced JavaScript

### ✅ Completed Lessons
- Note: ES9 + ES8 Async Await  
- ES10 (ES2019) (16m 49s) + Exercise  

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **ES8 (2017)**: solidified understanding of `async/await` for asynchronous programming.  
- **ES9 (2018)**: noted upcoming features like `Object rest/spread` and `Promise.finally()`.  
- **ES10 (2019)**: introduced `Array.flat()`, `Array.flatMap()`, and `Object.fromEntries()`.  
- Reinforced modern JavaScript evolution and how each version builds on the last.  
- Exercises helped apply new syntax in practical scenarios.  

---

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Implemented ES8 async/await in small projects.  
- Reviewed ES9 features conceptually for future application.  
- Practiced ES10 methods (`flat`, `flatMap`, `fromEntries`) with arrays and objects.  
- Completed exercises to reinforce ES10 concepts.  

---

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- Explore deeper error handling with async/await.  
- Compare ES9 and ES10 features in real-world frameworks.  
- Investigate performance implications of `Array.flat()` on large datasets.  
- Review compatibility of ES10 features across browsers.

## ✅ Summary
Strong progress in **Advanced JavaScript** today.  
Mastered ES8 async/await, noted ES9 features, and completed ES10 with exercises.  
This marks a key milestone in modern JavaScript mastery, preparing for ES11 and beyond.
