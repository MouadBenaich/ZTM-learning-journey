# 📅 Progress Log — December 19, 2025

## ✅ Overview
Continued the **Advanced JavaScript** module.  
Focused on scope, advanced control flow, ES5/ES6 features, advanced functions, advanced arrays, advanced objects, and new concepts like pass by value vs pass by reference and type coercion.

### ✅ Completed Lessons
- Pass By Value vs Pass By Reference (17m 06s)  
- Type Coercion (9m 02s)

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **Scope** reinforces variable accessibility rules across contexts.  
- **Advanced control flow** improves handling of complex conditional logic.  
- **ES5 vs ES6** highlights modern syntax improvements like arrow functions, `let`/`const`, and template literals.  
- **Advanced functions** emphasize higher-order functions, callbacks, and functional programming techniques.  
- **Advanced arrays** showcase powerful methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) for clean data manipulation.  
- **Advanced objects** introduce destructuring, shorthand properties, and modern object handling patterns.  
- **Pass by value vs reference** clarifies how primitives and objects behave differently when assigned or passed into functions.  
- **Type coercion** explains implicit and explicit conversions between types, and potential pitfalls in equality checks.

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Applied scope exercises to understand variable lifetimes.  
- Built examples with nested control flow structures.  
- Practiced ES6 syntax and compared with ES5 equivalents.  
- Implemented higher-order functions and callbacks in exercises.  
- Used array methods to solve practical coding challenges.  
- Explored object destructuring and shorthand properties in exercises.  
- Tested pass by value vs reference with arrays and objects.  
- Experimented with type coercion in equality comparisons and arithmetic operations.

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- Deepen understanding of closures and their relation to scope.  
- Explore async programming patterns with ES6+ features.  
- More practice with object methods and inheritance.  
- Investigate performance trade-offs of array and object operations.  
- Study best practices to avoid bugs caused by type coercion.

## ✅ Summary
Strong progress in **Advanced JavaScript** today.  
Learned scope, advanced control flow, ES5/ES6 syntax, advanced functions, advanced arrays, advanced objects, pass by value vs reference, and type coercion.  
These lessons strengthen modern JavaScript skills and prepare for upcoming topics like closures and asynchronous programming.
