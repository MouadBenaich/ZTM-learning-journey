# 📅 Progress Log — January 9, 2026

## ✅ Overview
Today I completed the **HTTP/JSON/AJAX + Asynchronous JavaScript** section, diving into how data flows across the web and how modern JavaScript handles asynchronous operations. This included working with Promises, Async/Await, and newer ES features for managing concurrent tasks.

## 💻 Completed Lessons / Tasks
- HTTP/HTTPS (19m 58s)  
- JSON (7m 25s)  
- JSON vs Form Data  
- AJAX (13m 37s)  
- Quick Note: Upcoming Video  
- Promises (22m 26s)  
- Exercise: Promises  
- ES8 — Async/Await (15m 22s)  
- Exercise: ES8 — Async/Await  
- ES9 (ES2018) (5m 21s)  
- ES9 (ES2018) — Async (11m 11s)  
- ES2020: `allSettled()` (4m 22s)  
- ES2021: `any()`  
- Reviewed ES6 → ES11 features  

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **HTTP/HTTPS** form the backbone of communication between clients and servers.  
- **JSON** is the standard format for transmitting structured data, simpler than form-encoded data.  
- **AJAX** enables asynchronous requests without reloading the page, powering dynamic web apps.  
- **Promises** provide a cleaner way to handle async flows compared to callbacks.  
- **Async/Await** makes asynchronous code more readable and easier to debug.  
- Newer ES features like `Promise.allSettled()` and `Promise.any()` give more control over concurrent operations.  

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Implemented a simple AJAX request to fetch JSON data.  
- Built a small demo using Promises to handle multiple async tasks.  
- Rewrote Promise-based code using **Async/Await** for clarity.  
- Experimented with `allSettled()` and `any()` to manage multiple API calls.  

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- When to prefer `Promise.allSettled()` vs `Promise.any()` in real-world projects.  
- Best practices for error handling in complex async flows.  

## ✅ Summary
A solid session focused on asynchronous JavaScript and modern ES features. I now feel more confident handling async operations, from basic HTTP requests to advanced Promise utilities, which will be crucial for building responsive React applications.
