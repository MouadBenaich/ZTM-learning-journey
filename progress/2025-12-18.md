## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **Scope** reinforces variable accessibility rules across different contexts.  
- **Advanced control flow** improves handling of complex conditional logic.  
- **ES5 vs ES6** highlights modern syntax improvements like arrow functions, `let`/`const`, and template literals.  
- **Advanced functions** emphasize higher-order functions, callbacks, and functional programming techniques.  
- **Advanced arrays** showcase powerful methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) for clean data manipulation.  
- **Advanced objects** introduce object destructuring, shorthand properties, and modern object handling patterns.  

---

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Applied scope exercises to understand variable lifetimes.  
- Built examples with nested control flow structures.  
- Practiced ES6 syntax and compared with ES5 equivalents.  
- Implemented higher-order functions and callbacks in exercises.  
- Used array methods to solve practical coding challenges.  
- Explored object destructuring and shorthand properties in exercises.

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- Deepen understanding of closures and their relation to scope.  
- Explore async programming patterns with ES6+ features.  
- More practice with object methods and inheritance.  
- Investigate performance trade-offs of array and object operations.

## ✅ Summary
Solid progress in **Advanced JavaScript** today.  
Learned scope, advanced control flow, ES5/ES6 syntax, advanced functions, advanced arrays, and advanced objects.  
These lessons strengthen modern JavaScript skills and prepare for upcoming topics like closures and asynchronous programming.
