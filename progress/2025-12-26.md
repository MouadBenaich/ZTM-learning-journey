## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- **ES2020 Part 3**: reinforced optional chaining and introduced `BigInt` for handling large integers.  
- **ES2021**: learned about `String.prototype.replaceAll`, logical assignment operators (`&&=`, `||=`, `??=`), and weak references.  
- **ES2022**: explored class field declarations, private methods, and ergonomic improvements for object handling.  
- **ES2023**: covered array `findLast`/`findLastIndex`, hashbang grammar for scripts, and new `Symbol` features.  
- Exercises emphasized writing cleaner, more expressive, and future‑proof JavaScript code.

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Implemented `BigInt` for precise calculations beyond `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.  
- Used `replaceAll` to simplify string manipulation tasks.  
- Applied logical assignment operators to streamline conditional updates.  
- Practiced defining private class fields and methods for encapsulation.  
- Tested `findLast` and `findLastIndex` on arrays to improve search logic.

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- Investigate browser support for ES2021–ES2023 features.  
- Explore performance trade‑offs of `BigInt` in computation‑heavy tasks.  
- Review best practices for private class fields in collaborative projects.  
- Experiment with `findLast` in real‑world data filtering scenarios.
