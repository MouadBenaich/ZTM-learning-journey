# 📅 Progress Log — December 14, 2025

## ✅ Overview
Today I advanced further in the **JavaScript fundamentals** module.  
This session focused on objects, loops, and DOM manipulation. I completed multiple exercises, including building parts of a Facebook‑style app, and practiced how JavaScript interacts directly with the webpage.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Objects allow grouping related data and behavior, forming the backbone of complex applications.  
- Loops enable efficient repetition and iteration over data structures.  
- DOM manipulation connects JavaScript logic to the actual webpage, enabling dynamic interactivity.  
- Event handling is central to user interaction, with callback functions ensuring responsive behavior.  
- jQuery simplifies DOM operations but modern JavaScript provides native methods that are equally powerful.

## 🧪 Practice Completed
- Built a **Facebook‑style app** using objects and arrays.  
- Implemented **loops** to handle repeated tasks and data iteration.  
- Practiced **DOM selectors** to target and manipulate webpage elements.  
- Created interactive features with **DOM events**.  
- Built a **Background Generator** project to dynamically change styles.

## ❓ Questions / Things to Revisit
- Explore deeper **object methods** and prototypes.  
- Compare modern DOM APIs with jQuery for efficiency.  
- Best practices for structuring event listeners in larger projects.  
- How to optimize loops for performance in real applications.

## ✅ Summary
A productive continuation of the **JavaScript fundamentals** module.  
I learned how to use objects, loops, and DOM manipulation to build interactive features and small projects. These lessons reinforced how JavaScript connects logic to the user interface.  
Next step: continue with **advanced DOM work, jQuery comparisons, and preparing for Git & GitHub basics**.
